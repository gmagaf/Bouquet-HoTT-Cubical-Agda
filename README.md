# Bouquet-HoTT-Cubical-Agda

This library provides a proof that the fundamental group of a Bouquet of circles of a type A,
also known as wedge of A circles, is homotopy equivalent to the Free Group generated by the
elements of A, inside Homotopy Type Theory. More precisely, given a Type A we may form the Type
Bouquet A as a Higher Inductive Type as follows:

```Agda
data Bouquet (A : Type ℓ) : Type ℓ where
  base : Bouquet A
  loop : A → base ≡ base
```

We prove that the fundamental group of this Type, i.e. the hset truncation of the loop space
of Bouquet A based on base, is equivalent to the Free Group of A and thus the two Types are equal,
using the Univalence Axiom.
Moreover, the library includes definitions and proofs of properties of the related concepts.

## Dependencies

We use Cubical Type Theory, a version of HoTT, and we have selected
[Cubical Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.2/language/cubical.html) for this library.
So, it's standard library is necessary in order for the project to Type check.
