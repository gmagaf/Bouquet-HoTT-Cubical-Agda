# Bouquet-HoTT-Cubical-Agda

This library provides a proof that the fundamental group of a wedge of A circles, also known as Bouquet, is homotopy equivalent to the Free Group generated by the elements of A, inside Homotopy Type Theory. More precisely, given a Type A we may form the Type WA as a Higher Inductive Type as follows:

```Agda
data W {ℓ}(A : Type ℓ) : Type ℓ where
  base : W A
  loop : A → base ≡ base
```

We prove that the fundamental group of this Type, i.e. the hset suspsension of the loop space of WA based on base, is equivalent to the Free Group of A and thus the two Types are equal, using the Univalence Axiom.
Moreover, the library includes definitions and proofs of properties of the related concepts.

## Dependencies

We use Cubical Type Theory, a version of HoTT, and we have selected [Cubical Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.2/language/cubical.html) for this library. So, it's standard library is necessary in order for the project to Type check.
